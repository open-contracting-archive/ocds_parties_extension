OCDS Entities/Parties Extension
==================================

This is a draft extension to update organization handling in OCDS, based on the requirements outlined in [Standard issue 368](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/368). 

This creates a top level block titled 'parties' to contain information on all the organisations involved in a contracting process. 

Note: The nomenclature of this extension is subject to change.
